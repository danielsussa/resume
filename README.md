## Market experience

**Company:** Prevent Senior (Since may/2019)<br/>
**Role**: FullStack developer<br/>
Member of the architecture team leader board, providing solutions for dealing with performance and better code on all teams. It's part of my work to provide tools for better code results and validations. In charge of implementing **continuous deployment** on all projects and changing the work methodology, like pursuing a new flow version , and doing code reviews.

**Company:** Acesso Digital (jun/2017 to may/2019)<br/>
**Role**: FullStack/DepOps developer<br/>
Challenged to deal with another language, it was my first time looking at GoLang, a different, simplist and beautiful code language. Besides that, I had to deal with continuous delivery, kubernetes, MSQ and other architectural projects to build a full web application. It was a challenge because everybody in the team was learning how to deal/cope with all of these technologies. It was a challenge too, to convert a big monolithic in some pieces of microservices, surprisingly worth in the end!

**Company:** Original Bank (aug/2015 to jun/2017)<br/>
**Role**: Backend developer<br/>
This was my first expressive professional challenge in IT field. This was a big step to learn how big companies (in this case, a big bank) used to work. I was responsible to deal with big code reviews and ensure that the quality of code going to production was good. I was in charge of the [Open API](https://developers.original.com.br/) and the OAUTH2 implementation, and to provide a meaningful mock application to help DEVs to code faster.

**Freelancer**  (aug/2012 to aug/2015)<br/>
**Role**: Web developer<br/>
It was my first contact with programming. I started to learn how to code, and I developed some websites for small companies. I didn't know about any framework, so I developed most of my application using pure JAVA servlet application and no framework to deal with frontend (pure JS, CSS and HTML). It was really good to start that way to improve my understanding about how things work. As my last task there, I helped a friend develop an e-commerce and then I could improve my skills even more, and after that, when I was confident enough, I started looking for a job in a big company

## Some phrases that I learned and I'm used to say

* Code so that everyone understands, review your code 1 week after writing it.
* Clean and explicit code, so that you can understand without comments, only following the script.
* Encapsulate really well working with domain and APIs defined.
* Code driven by domain, and not by technology. Everything could be plugged on your main code.
* Balance between simple and over engineer. Don't bring unnecessary complexity to your code.
* The decision of using a technology is: maturity, learning curve and community support.
