Hey there! I'm a fullstack software developer and I love to learn and teach. My goal is to improve day and day more my knowledge not only about technology, although how and when to use it.

## Personal work and codes

1. How about create my own Web framework!? this is the propose of [Light Flame](https://github.com/light-flame). Its a java functional framework based on Netty, with a lot of features to deal with restfull API, Websocket and Messaging. 
2. This is an article that I wrote to talk about [microservices versus monolithic](https://blog.geekhunter.com.br/arquitetura-de-microsservicos-x-arquitetura-monolitica/). It was posted on Geekhunter, a brazilian specialized app to hire DEV.
3. I love IOT too, there is a bunch of robots and stuffs that I did when I was starting to program. It was really funny at all!

## Certifications
1. ORACLE CERTIFIED ASSOCIATE JAVA SE 8 Programmer I - 1Z0-808

## Market experience

**Company:** Prevent Senior (Since may/2019)<br/>
**Role**: FullStack developer<br/>
I'm part of architecture team leader board, providing solutions for dealing with performance and better code on all teams. It's part of my work to provide tools for a better code result and validations. I was responsible to implement **continuos deployment** on all projects and change the methodology of work, like persuit a new versioning flow, and doing code reviews.

**Company:** Acesso Digital (jun/2017 to may/2019)<br/>
**Role**: FullStack/DepOps developer<br/>
It was a challenge to deal with another language. It was my first time looking at golang, a different, simplist and beatifull code language. Beside that, In this workplace a had to deal with continuos delivery, kubernetes, MSQ and other architectural projects to build a full web application. It was a challenge because everybody on team was learning to deal with all of this technologies. It was a challenge too, to convert a big monolithic in some pieces of microservices, but at the end, it worth!

**Company:** Original Bank (aug/2015 to jun/2017)<br/>
**Role**: Backend developer<br/>
This was my first expressive professional challenge in IT fields. This was a big step to learn how big companies (in this case, a big bank) used to work. I was responsible to deal with big code reviews and ensure that the quality of code going to production was good. I was responsible for the [Open API](https://developers.original.com.br/)  and the OAUTH2 implementation, and to provide a meaningful mock application to help DEVs to code faster.

**Freelancer**  (aug/2012 to aug/2015)<br/>
**Role**: Web developer<br/>
It was my first contact with programing. I started to learn to code, and I develop some websites for small companies. I didn't know about anyone framework, so I develop most part of my application using pure JAVA servlet application and no framework to deal with frontend (pure JS, CSS and HTML). It was really good to start that way to improve my understanding how things work. My last job I help a friend to develop a e-commerce and then I could improve even more my skills, and then, when I was confident enough, I started to look at a job in a big company 

## Some phrases that I learned and I'm used to say

* Code for everyone understand, review your code after 1 week that you wrote.
* Clean and explicit code, you can understand without comments, only follow the script.
* Encapsulate really well working with domain and APIs defined.
* Code driven by domain, and not by technology. Everything could be plugged on your main code.
* Balance between simple and over engineer. Don't bring unnecessary complexity to your code. 
* The decision of using a technology is: maturity, learning curve and community support.
