# Daniel Kanczuk 

I've been working in different companies and projects during this journey. I had the opportunity to work in a bank core business, startup (that currently turns out into a unicorn), and health care area. Today, I've been working in a multi-national fintech. 

Those experiences prepared me to deal with projects, clients, and company expectations. Also, how to work appropriately in a team and manage time between focus, collaborations, and other errands. 

Since all those companies are relatively new on the market, I am constantly learning new technologies and ways to deal with scalability, reliability, and practices like monitoring and dealing with all sets of tests before/during deployments.
